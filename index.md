# About Me

Hello everyone! I am current a student going for my bachelors in Computer Science and Computer Engineering with a minor in Mathematics. I usually spend my time doing work, research, youtube, playing the piano, or programming on the computer. I am currently creating mods for Minecraft for fun and keep a blog of just random things I think about.

Check me out on [Youtube](http://youtube.com/c/ChampionAsh5357) for all the videos I create and [my blog](https://thoughtsandexplanations.blogspot.com/) to just see some random writing I do.
