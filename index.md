# About Me

Hello everyone! I am currently a student going for my doctorate in Computer Science. I usually spend my time doing work, research, youtube, playing the piano, or programming on the computer. I am currently creating mods for Minecraft for fun.

Check me out on [Youtube](http://youtube.com/c/ChampionAsh5357) for all the videos I create.

## Minecraft Projects

### [Entity Armor Models](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/entity-armor-models)

All entities have the power to wear armor, but none of them are able to show it. So, I've decided to change that. This client-side mod allows you to view armor on all your favorite living entities in the game! You can check out the release on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/entity-armor-models).

### [Custom Ideas](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/custom-ideas)

As a way to express my gratitude over the years for the people supporting me, I created a mod incorporating every idea submitted to me in one. As of May 1st, 2019, the mod has recieved over 1000 downloads with 20 user-submitted ideas implemented. It was a year long endeavor being updated every month with new ideas. You can check out the mod on [CurseForge](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/custom-ideas).

### [Super Minecraft Brothers](https://www.planetminecraft.com/mod/111-super-mario-brothers-v001/)

Originally, this mod was supposed to be a direct replica of the original Super Mario Bros. for the Nintendo Entertainment System. However, due to a lot of modelling and lack of time, the project has been inactive for nearly a year. I was updating the mod to 1.13.2 to make it easier to support and making an entire game mechanic to it. You can check out the last pre-alpha release for 1.12.2 on [PlanetMinecraft](https://www.planetminecraft.com/mod/111-super-mario-brothers-v001/).
