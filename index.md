# About Me

Hello everyone! I am currently a student going for my bachelors in Computer Science and Computer Engineering with a minor in Mathematics. I usually spend my time doing work, research, youtube, playing the piano, or programming on the computer. I am currently creating mods for Minecraft for fun and keep a blog of just random things I think about.

Check me out on [Youtube](http://youtube.com/c/ChampionAsh5357) for all the videos I create and [my blog](https://thoughtsandexplanations.blogspot.com/) to just see some random writing I do.

## Minecraft Projects

### Custom Ideas

As a way to express my gratitude over the years for the people supporting me, I created a mod incorporating every idea submitted to me in one. As of May 1st, 2019, the mod has recieved over 1000 downloads with 20 user-submitted ideas implemented. It is my most active project being updated every month with new ideas. You can check out the mod on [CurseForge](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/custom-ideas) and [submit an idea](https://github.com/ChampionAsh5357/Custom-Ideas/issues) by creating an issue.

### Super Minecraft Brothers

Originally, this mod was supposed to be a direct replica of the original Super Mario Bros. for the Nintendo Entertainment System. However, due to a lot of modelling and lack of time, the project has been inactive for nearly a year. Currently, I am updating the mod to 1.13.2 to make it easier to support and making an entire game mechanic to it. You can check out the last pre-alpha release for 1.12.2 on [PlanetMinecraft](https://www.planetminecraft.com/mod/111-super-mario-brothers-v001/).

## Tutorials

There is currently nothing over here as these are still in the works. I'm hoping to transfer my knowledge in video game modification and programming in general here over the next few months.




Thank you to everyone who has supported me over the years and continue to support!
