# Getting Started

Hello Minecraft programmers! Welcome to modification making for 1.13.2. For this version of Minecraft, the creators of Forge decided to do an entire overhaul of the entire system to make it much better and foolproof for future versions of the game. Due to this, however, most of your code from 1.12.2 will pretty much be useless since most of the methods used has been redone is one way or another. So, I will help to guide you to create your modification for 1.13.2 and try to provide a useful source for updating your code to this version.

To get started, first you are going to need to download the following items:

## Required

### [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)

Minecraft was originally developed in a language called Java developed by the Oracle Corporation. Currently, the latest commercial release is for Java 8 while the latest development release is for Java 12. When deciding on a JDK version, I recommend using the latest commercial relase since its most likely the one everyone has on their computer. Either way, you need at least Java 8 in some capacity to be able to run the Forge development environment on your computer.

### Java Integrated Development Environment ([Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2019-03/r/eclipse-ide-enterprise-java-developers) or [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/))

### [Minecraft Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.13.2.html)

## Optional

### File Extractor

### Photo Editing Software
