# Main Mod File

Congrats on setting up your workspace! Welcome to part 2 of the introduction where we set up the basic mod file and folders for assets. You can delete any packages within src/main/java via the Project Explorer as we will be writing the code from scratch.

## Java Class

Let's start with the java class. Head over to the package explorer located by default on the left side of the screen. Right click src/main/java and go to New->Class. You should now see a screen where you can name the class and set the package. Usually, the package refers to the developer's website in reverse with an appended mod id. Let's assume we'll use **tutorial** as the id. So, the package should read 'domain.website.tutorial' (e.g. 'com.championash5357.tutorial' or 'io.github.championash5357.tutorial'). As for the class name, you can use the name of the mod id (e.g. 'Tutorial'). After setting both of these parameters, click Finish to create the class.

You should now see something that looks like:
```java
package domain.website.tutorial;

public class Tutorial {
    
}
```
