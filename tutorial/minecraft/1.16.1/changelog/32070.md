# 32.0.70
---

There are quite a few changes made to the package structure and the names of some files within our code.

## <a name="package-structure"></a>Package Structure <a href="#package-structure"><img src="../../../../images/link.png" alt="Link" style="width:20px;height:20px;"></a>
---

There has been a new package added called `common` that will hold all information that is currently not in `client`, `data`, or `server`. This is to separate the code that can be used on any side from the other three packages.

## <a name="serverproxy"></a>ServerProxy <a href="#serverproxy"><img src="../../../../images/link.png" alt="Link" style="width:20px;height:20px;"></a>
---

`ServerReference` has been renamed to `DedicatedServerReference`. This is to signify that the sided reference only runs on the dedicated server, not on both the integrated and dedicated server.
