There are quite a few changes made to the package structure and the names of some files within our code.

## <a name="package-structure"></a>Package Structure

There has been a new package added called `common` that will hold all information that is currently not in `client`, `data`, or `server`. This is to separate the code that can be used on any side from the other three packages.

## <a name="serverproxy"></a>ServerProxy

`ServerProxy` has been renamed to `DedicatedServerProxy`. This is to signify that the proxy only runs on the dedicated server, not on both the integrated and dedicated server.
