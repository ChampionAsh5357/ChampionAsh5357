		"1.16.1-0.0.11.0": "Added support for piglins. I forgot they existed as biped renderers.",
		"1.16.1-0.0.12.0": "Added support for slimes...and magma cubes. Can't forget the magma cubes... Fixes vex legs not rendering correct for armor. Fixes an issue with the creeper head layer when skulls are applied.",
		"1.16.1-0.0.13.0": "Definitely forgot about the magma cubes. Now there's magma cubes.",
		"1.16.1-0.0.14.0": "Code cleanup and hierarchy fixes. Switched from ATs to reflection storages for faster load times and better compatibility. Still need to implement ageable model difference AgeableModels. Also added that annoying update message. No worries, it can be disabled in the config :)",
		"1.16.1-0.0.15.0": "Implemented AgeableModel interface using Method storage via reflection. Restructured config to allow disabling of specific layers to change amount of resource allocation. Also added horses support.",

		"1.16.1-0.0.17.0": "The nether has leaked in! Blazes and ghasts are now supported! Entity Settings has been renamed and organized under Special Settings. Entity Settings will be used for enabling or disabling layers on a specific entity added by this mod.",

		"1.16.1-0.0.19.0": "Reorganized entire system to allow for mod development. Wrote javadocs for interfaces that should be used. Exclude sources that are irrelevant to utilizing this mod as a base. The file storage is currently named 'base' as 'api' does not seem to reflect the this mod very well.",
		"1.16.1-0.0.20.0": "Added the illagers. (They were so similar to witches). Renamed 'base' to 'api' because that's what it's supposed to be. Also, it would get confusing for other programmers. Also broke some more api, which is fine until 1.0 get released."
